# SMS based motor controlling system
This is a simple project using Arduino ATMega328 which uses SMS based control system for turning machine on and off. We have used a three phase contactor with a thermal relay interfaced  with a relay module.

This project uses Arduino ATMega328 with GSM Shield 900A. The AC power supply is provided to contactor coil in 3-phase contactor. To provide 12V DC Supply to the relay module, we used a Step-Down transformer with Bridge-Rectifier.
